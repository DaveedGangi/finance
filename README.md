Stage 2 - Expense Tracker Dashboard
Overview
This project is part of an ongoing Expense Tracker application that provides a dashboard with the following features:

Total Expenses: Displays the total expenses for the current month.

Category Breakdown: Displays a pie chart showing the breakdown of expenses by category.

Most Recent Transactions: Displays a list of the most recent transactions.

The dashboard uses React for the frontend and leverages Recharts for visualizations (pie chart). The data is fetched from an API and displayed in a user-friendly interface.

Features
1. Total Expenses
Displays the total amount of expenses for the current month.

Uses reduce() to aggregate expenses from the fetched data.

2. Category Breakdown
Uses a pie chart to display the percentage breakdown of expenses by category (e.g., Food, Rent, Transport).

Leverages Recharts for the pie chart implementation.

3. Most Recent Transactions
Displays the top 3 most recent transactions in a list format.

Shows the category and amount of each transaction.

Setup and Installation

Project Structure
src/: Contains all the source files for the project.

components/: Contains React components used in the application.

Dashboard.js: Main dashboard component displaying summary data.

App.js: Main entry point for the application, rendering the Dashboard.

index.js: Entry point for rendering the React application to the DOM.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Recharts: Charting library used to create interactive pie charts.

ClipLoader: Spinner component to show loading state.

CSS: Styling used for the layout and cards.

Data Flow
Fetching Data:

The application fetches transaction data, including expenses and categories, using a useEffect hook. The data is stored in the component's state using useState.

The data is aggregated and displayed in the form of summary cards and a pie chart.

Displaying Data:

The Total Expenses card shows the total amount spent for the current month.

The Category Breakdown is represented as a pie chart that displays the percentage of total expenses by category.

The Most Recent Transactions displays the latest transactions, showing the category and amount.

Example Output
Total Expenses
A card showing the total expenses for the current month.

Category Breakdown
A responsive pie chart visualizing the breakdown of expenses across categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Transport).

Most Recent Transactions
A list of the three most recent transactions, showing the category and amount.

Future Improvements
Date Filtering: Allow users to filter transactions by date or time range.

Transaction Details: Provide detailed views of each transaction when clicked.

Data Persistence: Store transaction data in a database or local storage.

User Authentication: Implement user login functionality to track personal expenses.

























































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
